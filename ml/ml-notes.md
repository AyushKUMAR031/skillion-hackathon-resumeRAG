- **Vector Embedding :** 
    - is how we translate things like text, images, and videos, etc into numbers that a computer can understand.
- **Sematic Similarity :** 
    - Sematic similarity of objects means and concepts, can be said by how close they are to each others as points in vector space.
- **Embedding :**
    - Embeddings are generated by Al models (such as Large Language Models) and have a large number of attributes or features, making their representation challenging to manage. In the context of Al and machine learning, these features represent different dimensions of the data that are essential for understanding patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.

    - That is why we need a specialized database designed specifically for handling this type of data. Vector databases like Pinecone fulfill this requirement by offering optimized storage and querying capabilities for embeddings.
